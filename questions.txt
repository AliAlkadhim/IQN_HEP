The NN always performs better if only trained on the gen jets, when adding the reco jets of the other quantities in 
the training features it just blows up....



In your samples, I understand that you have
* gen jets: "particles before they interact with the detector" 
	- I assume those
	are post-hadronization, right?
* reco jets: "particles that would be identified from measured tracks
and energy deposits in particle detectors"
* raw reco jets: reco jets that are unfolded - applied more corrections so that 
they look as similar as possible to gen jets.

- do you compare gen to reco or gen to raw reco?

- in order to compare to results of NP corrections, we need pre-hadronization/MPI and post-hadronization/MPI samples. 
It might be nice to compare results to NP correction factors using this.

- Also, we might try to do a full blown hypothesis testing to compare between the predicted densities and the reco densities using some test statistic like earth movers distance
